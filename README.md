# Project Description

This was a 2 week project that helped me practice how to use React and to familiarize myself with its features. This project also implements a lot of JSX and CSS/HTML. I wanted to build a simple game that made me reminisced about my childhood. Tic Tac Toe is definitely one of the most well renowned children's game that I am sure you have placed before.

The part that I struggled with the most for this project was to understand how to create ways for the app to know when a player has won. The simplest way of doing so was to list all the possible ways and combinations a player can possibly win. That way, the code will run through these scenarios every time a player makes their move to check if any of them matched those combinations.
